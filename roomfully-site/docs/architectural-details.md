  "host_about": "My 2 bdrm apartment is a 2nd floor walk-up in a quiet, vintage co-op building, overlooking a pleasant courtyard.  I allow only one guest so you don't have to worry about other strangers in the apartment. (I occupy the 2nd bedroom).  A single traveler will feel safe and be comfortable here. If you are visiting the University of Chicago - or visiting your UChicago student who hasn't enough room to host you - my location will allow you to walk to your destination. My apartment is probably the Airbnb listing most convenient to the Chicago Theological Seminary. \n\nIf you have been skeptical about  trying Airbnb, you will be pleasantly surprised at how drama-free the experience can be. The key is to read the listing (including house rules) and the reviews, then select a place that meets your safety, location, and comfort needs.\n\nLet me know the purpose of your trip to Chicago so I can help you determine if my apartment or Hyde Park location is (or isn't) right for your visit.  I may even be able to suggest a more appropriate location. In any event, I will answer your inquiries quickly and honestly.",
